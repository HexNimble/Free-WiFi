# 🎯 QR Prank Website

A simple prank website built with **HTML + CSS** and hosted using **GitHub Pages**.

The idea is straightforward:
- A link is converted into a **QR code**
- Someone scans the QR code
- They’re redirected to this site
- A funny image pops up in the center with a short animation  
  👉 *Get pranked.*

No scripts, no tracking, no downloads — just a harmless joke.

## 🚀 Live Demo

> This project is meant for **entertainment purposes only**.

- Styled with pure CSS
- Centered image + text
- Simple pop / shake animation
